I created my form using the bootstrap controls, I added index.html, Portfolio.html and Contact.html. I created a new repository and was able to publish to the web.

I created a carousel of 3 images for the porfolio page.
I added an upload button to my form, along with multiple choice and drop down.
Instead of making the footer "sticky", I made the Nav bar "sticky" as it is more important than the footer.

thanks,
